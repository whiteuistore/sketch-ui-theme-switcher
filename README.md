**UI Theme Switcher** is a professional Sketch plugin designed to automate the transition between Light and Dark themes. It intelligently swaps Symbol Instances and Shared Styles across your Artboards based on your naming conventions.

## 🚀 Features


* **Symbol Swapper:** Automatically replaces "Light" symbols with their "Dark" counterparts.
* **New Frames/Artboards:** Generate new frames with automatically applied "Light" symbols with their "Dark" counterparts.
* **Recursive Style Switcher:** Updates Shared Styles for vector shapes, groups, and stacks, no matter how deep they are nested.
* **Smart Detection:** Skips layers that are already in the target theme to prevent redundant operations.
* **Detailed Feedback:** Provides alerts if a matching symbol or style is missing from your document or library.

## 🏷 Naming Convention (Required)

For the plugin to work correctly, your Symbols and Shared Styles must follow a specific naming suffix. The plugin looks for matches at the **end** of the name.

### 1. Symbols
Your symbols must have identical paths/names, differing only by the suffix:
* **Light Suffixes:** `onLight` or `LightUI`
* **Dark Suffixes:** `onDark` or `DarkUI`

**Example:**
* `Symbol/abc/onLight` ↔️ `Symbol/abc/onDark`
* `Icons/Settings/LightUI` ↔️ `Icons/Settings/DarkUI`

### 2. Shared Styles (Layer Styles)
The same logic applies to Shared Styles for shapes and groups:
* `Background/Fill - onLight` ↔️ `Background/Fill - onDark`
* `UI/Button/Primary/LightUI` ↔️ `UI/Button/Primary/DarkUI`

> **Note:** The script is case-sensitive. Ensure the suffixes match exactly as shown above.
